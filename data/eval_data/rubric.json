    "question": "In specific domains, such as healthcare, using large language models (LLMs) in combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can effectively reduce hallucinations, while attribution can provide valid citation evidence for the generated answers, making it easier for subsequent evaluation and validation. A method was attempted where GPT-4 was used to generate data, followed by fine-tuning the LLM using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to directly produce answers and attributions. It was observed that for simple questions (single citation), the model performs well, but for more complex questions, the model's performance declines. After investigating, it was found that the generated dataset primarily contained simple questions, and the citation accuracy of GPT-4 itself is low (around 75%). How can high-quality data be generated to improve performance on complex questions?",
